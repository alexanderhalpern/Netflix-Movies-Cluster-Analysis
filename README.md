# Purpose: 
Generate a graphical depiction of the Netflix Movie and TV Show in order to determine trends in the data and visualize which movie and TV-show categories are popular.


# Methodology:
Start by taking the description for each movie and TV show in the Netflix catalog and generate a numerical representation of each description 
by using sentence embeddings. By representing each catalog entry with a vector, we can then clustering catalog entries based on their descriptions
and then use dimensionality reduction so that we can plot movies in 2D space. 

# Explore the Results
This means that when we look at the graph of movies, similar movies are closer together in space, and different movies are far apart.
